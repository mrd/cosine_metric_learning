quick and dirty:

1) edit train_mars.py and update IMAGE_SHAPE (it's height, width, depth)
2) look at run.sh to find the /checkpoints directory
3) make sure the RUNID is not already taken
4) edit train.sh and change the RUNID to something appropriate, e.g. mars-128x64x3
5) ./run.sh ./train.sh
6) edit finalize.sh, change the RUNID, then ./run.sh it
7) make sure saved_model/ dir is removed or moved out of the way
8) edit freeze.sh, change the RUNID, then ./run.sh it
9) ./run.sh python3 tflite_convert.py
10) there should be a new converted_model.tflite file
